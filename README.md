# Predict-Then-Debias_Bootstrap

This Github repository gives the corresponding code to the paper entitled "Prediction-Powered Inference with Imputed Covariates and Nonuniform Sampling" by Dan M. Kluger, Kerri Lu, Tijana Zrnic, Sherrie Wang, and Stephen Bates. It also provides a function titled "PTDBootModularized" that implements various variants of the Predict-Then-Debias Bootstrap. Descriptions for the input argument to the function "PTDBootModularized.R" can be found at the top of that function's file.

Please note that this repository will be edited in the coming days to improve user-friendliness. For example, we plan to make the notation in the code more consistent with that in the corresponding paper. In the current version of the sofware, "calib" or "calibration" refers to the complete sample and "main" or "noncalib" refers to the incomplete sample. "m" is the total number of samples (refered to as "N" in the paper), and "nLabel" or "nCalib" (refered to as "n" in the paper) is number of complete samples. Please direct any questions or bug reports to dkluger@mit.edu.
