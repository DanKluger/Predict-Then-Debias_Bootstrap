# Predict-Then-Debias_Bootstrap

This Github repository gives the corresponding code to the paper entitled "Prediction-Powered Inference with Imputed Covariates and Nonuniform Sampling" by Dan M. Kluger, Kerri Lu, Tijana Zrnic, Sherrie Wang, and Stephen Bates. It also provides a function titled "PTDBootModularized" that implements various variants of the Predict-Then-Debias bootstrap.

Please note that this repository will be edited in the coming days to improve user-friendliness (e.g., we plan to make the notation in the code more consistent with that in the corresponding paper). Please direct any questions or bug reports to dkluger@mit.edu.
